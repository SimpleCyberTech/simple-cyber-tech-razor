            <p class="text-center mb-4">Penetration testing is security research that helps you understand your real security posture. Our certified ethical hackers use the same techniques as real attackers to identify vulnerabilities in your systems, networks, and applications.</p>
            <p class="text-center mb-6">Unlike vulnerability scanning (which just lists known issues), penetration testing proves whether vulnerabilities can actually be exploited and what data could be accessed. This actionable intelligence helps you prioritize fixes that matter most to your business.</p>
