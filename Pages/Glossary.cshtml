                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Advanced Threat Detection (ATD)</h4>
                    <p>A security technology that goes beyond basic antivirus to identify sophisticated attacks. It uses behavioral analysis and machine learning to detect threats that look like normal activity but are actually malicious. Essential for catching zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats (APTs).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Antivirus Software</h4>
                    <p>A program designed to prevent, detect, and remove malware (malicious software) from your computer. Traditional antivirus looks for known threats; modern antivirus also uses behavioral analysis to catch new threats. However, antivirus alone is not sufficient for comprehensive security.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Authentication</h4>
                    <p>The process of verifying that someone is who they claim to be. In security, this typically involves passwords, but stronger authentication uses multiple factors: something you know (password), something you have (phone or security key), or something you are (fingerprint). Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is more secure than passwords alone.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- B -->
            <div class="glossary-section" id="letter-B">
                <h2 class="glossary-letter">B</h2>
                
                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Backup</h4>
                    <p>A copy of your data stored separately from the original. Regular backups are your insurance against data loss from ransomware, hardware failure, or accidents. Best practice: follow the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies of data, 2 different storage types, 1 copy offsite. Backups should be tested regularly to ensure they can actually be restored.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Botnet</h4>
                    <p>A network of compromised computers controlled by an attacker without the owners' knowledge. Each infected computer (a "bot") can be used to send spam, launch attacks, or steal data. Botnets often spread through malware or unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Brute Force Attack</h4>
                    <p>A hacking technique where an attacker tries many password combinations until they find the right one. Like trying every key on a keyring to open a lock. Defenses include: strong passwords, account lockouts after failed attempts, and rate limiting. This is why "Password123!" is worse than "correct-horse-battery-staple".</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Compliance</h4>
                    <p>Following rules and regulations that apply to your industry. Examples: HIPAA (healthcare), PCI-DSS (payment cards), GDPR (EU privacy), SOC 2 (service providers). Compliance is not just about avoiding fines; it means implementing security controls that protect your business and your customers' data.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
                    <p>The practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. Cybersecurity includes technology (firewalls, encryption), processes (security policies), and people (training, awareness).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Cyber Threat</h4>
                    <p>Any potential danger to your digital assets: data, systems, networks, or reputation. Threats can be intentional (hackers, competitors) or accidental (employee mistakes, hardware failure). A threat is the potential for harm; a vulnerability is a weakness that could be exploited; and risk is the likelihood and impact of that happening.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Cybersecurity Insurance</h4>
                    <p>Also called cyber liability insurance. Coverage for costs related to data breaches, ransomware attacks, business interruption, and legal liability. Insurance is NOT a substitute for security controls, but it helps recover from incidents. Most insurers require certain security measures before providing coverage.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Data Breach</h4>
                    <p>Unauthorized access to sensitive information, usually resulting in data theft or exposure. A breach may be discovered immediately or months later. Under regulations like GDPR and CCPA, you must notify affected parties within specific timeframes. Prevention is far cheaper than managing a breach.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>DDoS Attack (Distributed Denial of Service)</h4>
                    <p>A cyberattack where multiple computers flood a website or service with requests, overwhelming it and making it unavailable to legitimate users. It's like thousands of people trying to enter a store at once, blocking the door. DDoS protection monitors traffic patterns and filters out malicious requests.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)</h4>
                    <p>A documented process for how your business will continue operating after a major incident: data breach, ransomware, natural disaster, or service failure. It includes backups, alternative systems, communication plans, and recovery time objectives (RTO). Every business should have one.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- E -->
            <div class="glossary-section" id="letter-E">
                <h2 class="glossary-letter">E</h2>
                
                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Encryption</h4>
                    <p>Scrambling data using mathematical algorithms so only authorized people with the encryption key can read it. Encryption protects data in transit (HTTPS on websites) and at rest (encrypted files). Even if a hacker steals encrypted data, they can't read it without the key.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Endpoint</h4>
                    <p>Any device connected to your network: computers, laptops, phones, tablets, printers, IoT devices. Each endpoint is a potential security risk if not protected. Endpoint security includes antivirus, firewalls, encryption, and monitoring.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</h4>
                    <p>Advanced security software installed on individual devices (endpoints) that continuously monitors for suspicious behavior and responds to threats. EDR goes beyond antivirus by using AI and behavioral analysis to catch sophisticated attacks. It's like a security team watching each computer 24/7.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- F -->

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Firewall</h4>
                    <p>A security barrier that monitors and controls network traffic coming in and out of your network. A firewall is like a border guard checking passports. It blocks unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic. Most businesses use both network firewalls (at the router) and personal firewalls (on each device).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Firmware</h4>
                    <p>Software that controls how hardware devices work. Examples: router firmware, printer firmware, device firmware. Firmware can have vulnerabilities, so it's critical to keep it updated. Many security breaches start with unpatched firmware.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</h4>
                    <p>European Union regulation that protects personal data of EU residents. Even if your business is in the US, GDPR applies if you handle EU customer data. Requirements include obtaining consent, data privacy, breach notification, and user rights. Non-compliance fines reach €20 million or 4% of annual revenue.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Hacker</h4>
                    <p>Someone who gains unauthorized access to computer systems. Not all hackers are criminals: "white hat" hackers help find vulnerabilities; "black hat" hackers steal data or cause harm; "gray hat" hackers operate in gray areas. Cybersecurity professionals are ethical hackers who help organizations find and fix problems.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)</h4>
                    <p>US law protecting patient health information. If you work in healthcare, you must implement HIPAA-compliant security: access controls, encryption, audit logs, breach notification. Violations carry fines up to $50,000 per incident.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>HTTPS</h4>
                    <p>Secure version of HTTP (web protocol) that encrypts data between your browser and a website. Look for the padlock icon in your browser. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption, so eavesdroppers can't see your passwords or personal information. Any website handling sensitive data should use HTTPS.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h4>Security Awareness Training</h4>
                    <p>Education for employees about security risks and best practices. Topics: password security, phishing recognition, data handling, incident reporting. Regular training (at least annually, ideally quarterly) significantly reduces the risk of human error leading to breaches. Employees are your first line of defense.</p>

                    <h4>SOC 2 Compliance</h4>
                    <p>Security certification for service providers (cloud, SaaS, hosting companies). SOC 2 assesses controls in five areas: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. If your vendors handle sensitive data, ask for their SOC 2 certification.</p>

                    <h4>Social Engineering</h4>
                    <p>Manipulation of people to bypass security controls. Attacker might pretend to be IT support and ask for your password. Social engineering exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Defense: verify identities, follow security policies, trust your instincts, report suspicious requests.</p>

                    <h4>SSL/TLS</h4>
                    <p>Encryption protocols that secure data in transit over the internet. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is older; TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the modern standard. They establish encrypted connections (HTTPS websites). Every business website should use TLS.</p>

                    <h4>Threat</h4>
                    <p>Any potential danger to your systems or data. Threats can be external (hackers, malware) or internal (disgruntled employees, accidental deletion). A threat only becomes a problem if there's a vulnerability to exploit.</p>

                    <h4>Threat Intelligence</h4>
                    <p>Information about current and emerging cyber threats, attack methods, and threat actors. Businesses use threat intelligence to understand what attacks might target them and how to defend against them. Intelligence includes indicators of compromise (IOCs), attack patterns, and attacker information.</p>

                    <h4>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4>
                    <p>A type of multi-factor authentication requiring two forms of identity verification. Examples: password + phone code, email + security key. Significantly more secure than passwords alone.</p>

                    <h4>Vulnerability</h4>
                    <p>A weakness in your systems that could be exploited by an attacker. Examples: unpatched software, weak passwords, misconfigured systems, lack of encryption. Vulnerabilities are found through security testing; fixing them is part of your security strategy.</p>

                <div class="glossary-term">
                    <h4>Vulnerability Scan</h4>
                    <p>Automated scan of your systems to identify known vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans use vulnerability databases (CVE—Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) to find unpatched software, weak configurations, and other issues. Regular scanning (monthly or quarterly) helps you stay ahead of attackers.</p>

                    <h4>Vulnerability Assessment</h4>
                    <p>More detailed than a scan, a vulnerability assessment uses both automated and manual testing to identify weaknesses, prioritize them, and recommend fixes. Unlike penetration testing, assessments don't exploit vulnerabilities—they just identify them.</p>

                    <h4>Zero-Day Exploit</h4>
                    <p>An attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability (one that developers haven't had time to patch). "Zero-day" means attackers had zero days to prepare a fix. Zero-day exploits are rare, sophisticated, and dangerous. Defenses include: keep systems up-to-date, use behavior-based detection, limit user privileges.</p>
